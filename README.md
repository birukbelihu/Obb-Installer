Install Obb Files Of Apps & Games Easily In Your Android Device

## Description

**Obb Installer** is an Android app that lets you install Obb files of applications & games in your Android device with ease.

An **Obb (Opaque Binary Blob)** file is a file format used by Android apps to store additional assets or resources that are too large to be bundled directly with the APK (Android Package) file. These files can include graphics, media files, or other types of data needed by the app. Obb files are typically used for games or apps that require a large amount of additional content beyond what can be included in the APK itself.
